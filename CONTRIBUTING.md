TWM was mostly written in Coffee Script, 
all the source code can be viewed in `src/`.
And some gjs scripts are written in Javascript, in `gjs/`.
Simply pull a request if you want to contribute.
If you are not famililar with Coffee Script, you can modify the js files, and pull a request, I will update the code written in Coffee.
